## Project Description
This is the _hello-world_ project. It is a GitHub tutorial where I am learning how to interact with the system on a basic level. I wonder what I can accomplish on GitHub and how it can help me as a programmer and analyst.

## How to Run the Program
Currently not working on a program for this repository.
